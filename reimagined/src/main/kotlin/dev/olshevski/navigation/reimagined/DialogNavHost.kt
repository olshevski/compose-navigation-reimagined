/**
 * A navigation host specifically suited for showing dialogs. It is based on [AnimatedNavHost] and
 * provides smoother transition between dialogs rather than simple [NavHost] - there will be
 * no visible scrim flickering.
 *
 * Same as other NavHosts it also selects UI for every destination and provides saved state and
 * Android architecture components (Lifecycle, ViewModelStore, SavedStateRegistry) through
 * [CompositionLocalProvider] for every unique [NavEntry] in the [controller's][controller]
 * backstack.
 *
 * Note that DialogNavHost doesn't wrap your composables into a [Dialog]. You need to use
 * either `Dialog` or `AlertDialog` composable inside a [contentSelector] yourself.
 *
 * @param controller the navigation controller that will provide its backstack to this
 * DialogNavHost. The last entry of the backstack is always the currently displayed entry.
 * You should do all backstack modifications through the same instance of [NavController],
 * but setting a different [NavController] will be handled correctly.
 *
 * @param emptyBackstackPlaceholder an optional placeholder composable that will
 * be displayed when the backstack is empty. In the majority of cases you don't need
 * to set this. Note that the provided composable wouldn't get its own scoped components.
 *
 * @param contentSelector provides a composable that corresponds to the current last destination
 * in the backstack. In other words, here is where you select UI to show (e.g. a screen). Also,
 * provides additional functionality of the DialogNavHost through the [NavHostScope].
