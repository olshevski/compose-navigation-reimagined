/**
 * Allows you to create new NavHosts with different custom layouts and transitions, reusing the
 * whole internal state and architecture components management intact.
 *
 * BaseNavHost gives you access to the whole backstack of entries through [NavSnapshot],
 * so it is possible to lay out and display several entries or even the whole backstack at the same
 * time.
 *
 * BaseNavHost uses [NavSnapshots][NavSnapshot] as anchor points of navigation. The transition
 * between two NavSnapshots is defined with [transition]. BaseNavHost passes you the snapshot
 * changes as an input parameter of `transition`. You may choose to switch to the passed target
 * snapshot immediately as in [NavHost] or with some animation as in [AnimatedNavHost].
 * The returned snapshot is what notifies BaseNavHost of when the current transition to
 * the requested snapshot ends: simply return the previous snapshot until you finish transitioning
 * to the new target snapshot.  When you are done, return the target snapshot.
 *
 * This is similar to how [updateTransition] treats its `targetState` and `currentState`:
 * `currentState` is set to `targetState` only when  transition ends. You may think of the input
 * parameter of [transition] as `targetState` and the returned value as `currentState`.
 *
 * BaseNavHost does the internal queueing. It would not send you the next target snapshot unless
 * you finish the transition and return the target snapshot back as a result of [transition].
 * Only then the next target snapshot will be passed into `transition`.
 *
 * All library's default NavHosts use BaseNavHost internally, so you may explore their sources as
 * examples.
 *
 * **Note:** this is still an early public version of the API. It may get some changes
 * in the future.
 *
 * @param backstack the backstack from a [NavController] that will be used to observe navigation
 * changes
 *
 * @param scopeSpec specifies scopes for every destination. This gives you the ability to easily
 * create and access scoped [ViewModelStoreOwners][ViewModelStoreOwner]. You may set it to
 * [EmptyScopeSpec] if you don't want your custom NavHost to support scoping.
 *
 * @param visibleItems controls the lifecycle states of [NavHostEntries][NavHostEntry].
 * By default, only the last entry is considered active and promoted to
 * [RESUMED][Lifecycle.State.RESUMED] state. With this function parameter, you can have several
 * entries receive `RESUMED` state. It is also possible to control lifecycle states of entries
 * dynamically. BaseNavHost will subscribe to all [State] object changes read inside [visibleItems].
 *
 * @param transitionQueueing the strategy of processing incoming transitions when transition
 * animations run slower than being added
